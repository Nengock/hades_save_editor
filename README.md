# Hades Save Editor
A project to enable easy editing of Hades savegames.

Given the engine similarities, I suspect it may work for bastion and transistor too, with some minor tweaks to the save schema.

WIP. Basic UI, with editable currencies. Will probably break your game and ruin your life. Personally it has done so on mine :sweat_smile:


### Getting started

Ensure you have Python 3+ installed. Clone this repo or download the source as a [zip](https://github.com/zsennenga/hades_save_editor/archive/master.zip) and extract it. In the extracted folder,

1. (Optional) Setup a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#installing-pip)

2. Install the dependencies via pip

        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
3. Start the editor

        python3 main.py
4. Once the editor is running, load up your save file
